# Feature Breakdown Template

## When to Use

Use this template when a feature request is too large to implement as a single feature.

## Template

```markdown
# Feature Breakdown: {{EPIC_NAME}}

## Assessment

The requested feature is large and should be broken down into multiple features.

## Recommended Breakdown

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description | Dependencies |
|------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| 001_{{FEATURE_1}} | {{Feature 1 Name}} | {{Description}} | None |
```
