# User Story Guidelines

## INVEST Framework

Every user story must be INVEST-compliant:

- **I**ndependent - Can be developed separately
- **N**egotiable - Details can be discussed
- **V**aluable - Delivers clear value
- **E**stimable - Can be estimated with confidence
- **S**mall - Completable in 1-3 days
- **T**estable - Has verifiable acceptance criteria

## Story Decomposition Patterns

1. **CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete as separate stories
2. **User Flow Steps** - Each major step as a story
3. **Happy Path vs Edge Cases** - Separate stories for edge cases
4. **By Screen/Page** - Each major screen as a story
5. **By User Role** - Different roles as different stories

## Acceptance Criteria Best Practices

- Use specific, observable behaviors
- Include concrete values and constraints
- Cover happy path and edge cases
- Be testable and verifiable
- Include business rules

## Coverage Verification

Ensure 100% coverage of:
- All functional requirements
- All user flows
- All screens
- All business rules
- All edge cases
