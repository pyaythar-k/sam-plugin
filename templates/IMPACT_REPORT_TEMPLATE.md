## Next Steps

1. **Review affected tasks**: Verify that each directly impacted task is still valid
2. **Update dependencies**: Modify task dependencies if the change alters the implementation sequence
3. **Re-verify completed tasks**: For any completed tasks in the impact list, verify they still function correctly
4. **Update user stories**: If acceptance criteria change, update the corresponding user stories
5. **Communicate changes**: Notify team members working on dependent tasks
